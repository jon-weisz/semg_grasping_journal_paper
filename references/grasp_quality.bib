pages={839-850}, 
abstract={Precision grasp synthesis has received a lot of attention in past few last years. However, real mechanical hands can hardly assure that the fingers will precisely touch the object at the computed contact points. The concept of independent contact regions (ICRs) was introduced to provide robustness to finger positioning errors during an object grasping: A finger contact anywhere inside each of these regions assures a force-closure grasp, despite the exact contact position. This paper presents an efficient algorithm to compute ICRs with any number of frictionless or frictional contacts on the surface of any 3-D object. The proposed approach generates the independent regions by growing them around the contact points of a given starting grasp. A two-phase approach is provided to find a locally optimal force-closure grasp that serves as the starting grasp, considering as grasp quality measure the largest perturbation wrench that the grasp can resist, independently of the perturbation direction. The proposed method can also be applied to compute ICRs when several contacts are fixed beforehand. The approach has been implemented, and application examples are included to illustrate its performance.},

abstract={We discuss stability of 3D grasps by using a three-dimensional spring model (3D spring model). Many works have described stability of a frictionless grasp. These works used a one-dimensional spring model (1D spring model) for representation of frictionless contact as a matter of course. However, a 1D spring model involves the following problems: (i) displacement of a finger is restricted to one dimension along the initial normal at contact point; and (ii) it is not clearly considered that a finger generates contact force to the object along the normal direction only. To overcome the problems and provide accurate grasp stability, we introduce a 3D spring model. Then a finger's displacement is relaxed and a finger's contact force is precisely formulated. We analyze grasp stability from the viewpoint of the potential energy method. From numerical examples, we show that there exists an optimum contact force for stable grasp. Moreover, we also analyze a frictional grasp by using contact kinematics of pure rolling. By comparing frictional grasp stability with a frictionless one, we prove that friction enhances stability of a grasp.},

abstract={Humans are adept at grasping different objects robustly for different tasks. Robotic grasping has made significant progress, but still has not reached the level of robustness or versatility shown by human grasping. It would be useful to understand what parameters (called grasp measures) humans optimize as they grasp objects, how these grasp measures are varied for different tasks, and whether they can be applied to physical robots to improve their robustness and versatility. This paper demonstrates a new way to gather human-guided grasp measures from a human interacting haptically with a robotic arm and hand. The results revealed that a human-guided strategy provided grasps with higher robustness on a physical robot even under a vigorous shaking test (91%) when compared with a state-of-the-art automated grasp synthesis algorithm (77%). Furthermore, orthogonality of wrist orientation was identified as a key human-guided grasp measure, and using it along with an automated grasp synthesis algorithm improved the automated algorithm's results dramatically (77% to 93%).},

abstract={An important ability of a robot that interacts with the environment and manipulates objects is to deal with the uncertainty in sensory data. Sensory information is necessary to, for example, perform online assessment of grasp stability. We present methods to assess grasp stability based on haptic data and machine-learning methods, including AdaBoost, support vector machines (SVMs), and hidden Markov models (HMMs). In particular, we study the effect of different sensory streams to grasp stability. This includes object information such as shape; grasp information such as approach vector; tactile measurements from fingertips; and joint configuration of the hand. Sensory knowledge affects the success of the grasping process both in the planning stage (before a grasp is executed) and during the execution of the grasp (closed-loop online control). In this paper, we study both of these aspects. We propose a probabilistic learning framework to assess grasp stability and demonstrate that knowledge about grasp stability can be inferred using information from tactile sensors. Experiments on both simulated and real data are shown. The results indicate that the idea to exploit the learning approach is applicable in realistic scenarios, which opens a number of interesting venues for the future research.},

               Active compliance enables robots to carry out tasks in the presence of significant sensing and control errors. Compliant motions are quite difficult for humans to specify, however. Furthermore, robot programs are quite sensitive to details of geometry and to error characteristics and must, therefore, be constructed anew for each task. These factors motivate the search for automatic synthesis tools for robot program ming, especially for compliant motion. This paper describes a formal approach to the synthesis of compliant-motion strategies from geometric descriptions of assembly operations and explicit estimates of errors in sensing and control. A key aspect of the approach is that it provides criteriafor correct ness of compliant-motion strategies.
