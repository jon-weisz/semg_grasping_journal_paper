abstract = {In this paper we outline a grasp planning system designed to augment the cortical control of a prosthetic arm and hand. A key aspect of this system it the ability to combine online user input and autonomous planning to enable the execution of stable grasping tasks. While user input can ultimately be of any modality, the system is being designed to adapt to partial or noisy information obtained from grasp-related activity in the primate motor cortex. First, principal component analysis is applied to the observed kinematics of physiologic grasping to reduce the dimensionality of hand posture space and simplify the planning task for on-line use. The planner then accepts control input in this reduced-dimensionality space, and uses it as a seed for a hand posture optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing. We present two applications of this algorithm, using data collected from both primate and human subjects during grasping, to demonstrate its ability to synthesize stable grasps using partial control input in real or near-real time.},

High number of degrees of freedom of control are needed to successfully complete a grasping or manipulating task.
        
Taylor et al. enable a primate to directly control linear velocity through 3 DOFs in real time.  This control was achieved by measuring the activity of individual cortical neurons that correspond to the preferred directions.  
        
Velliste also demonstrated continuous cortical control of a robotic pincer.
        
While this approach is effective for transport and pinching.  The nature of dexterous grasping is different.
4-DOF manipulator whose main function is grasping to bring the hand to a certain point in 3-D space.  
        
In this setting even a single degree of freedom can be helpful.  Grasp quality function becomes Q = f(a,w) 
        
        
        
In our approach we use eigengrasps.  Santello et al. have showed that two such basis vectors can account for more than 80\%of the human hand grasp posture over 57 objects.
        
Efficient algorithm which operates in a 2 dimensional subspace to synthesize grasps.  Operaters on to produce pregrasms which NEARLY conform to objects.
        
        
        
Functionality and interactivity - find a stable grasp fast
Adjustable cortical/ computer control - Operator control vs synthetic behavior should be directly adjustable, allowing both learning and adaptation.
        
Biomimetic synthesis: in the absense of complete control, grasps will be created such that automatically controlled parameters will resembler observed physiologic behavior as possible.
        
        
        
        
As a prosthetic device, any actuated device is good enough.  In contrast, the human hand is 24-DOF manipulator which is designed to conform to the surface of an object.  
The activity of some motor neurons is correlated with finger movements, or joint angles, however 24 degrees of freedom is unlikely to be recovered.  Furthermore, the robotic hand generally has different kinematics.  Translating actuation of robot with a particular non-physiologic kinematic configuration could be difficult
        
        
Grasp planning system should incorporate some criteria in order to be appropriate for neural prosthetic control.

               In this paper we focus on the concept of low-dimensional posture subspaces for                     artificial hands. We begin by discussing the applicability of a hand                     configuration subspace to the problem of automated grasp synthesis; our results                     show that low-dimensional optimization can be instrumental in deriving effective                     pre-grasp shapes for a number of complex robotic hands. We then show that the                     computational advantages of using a reduced dimensionality framework enable it                     to serve as an interface between the human and automated components of an                     interactive grasping system. We present an on-line grasp planner that allows a                     human operator to perform dexterous grasping tasks using an artificial hand. In                     order to achieve the computational rates required for effective user                     interaction, grasp planning is performed in a hand posture subspace of highly                     reduced dimensionality. The system also uses real-time input provided by the                     operator, further simplifying the search for stable grasps to the point where                     solutions can be found at interactive rates. We demonstrate our approach on a                     number of different hand models and target objects, in both real and virtual                     environments.

@article{Miller2004,
abstract = {Grasping in an industrial setting is generally accomplished with low complexity grippers which offer a high degree of reliability within a structured environment. But, as robots are moved out of the factory into more unstructured settings, they will need more flexible devices to grasp or manipulate objects. To fill this need, articulated hands are being designed with more and more degrees of freedom, but this additional flexibility comes at a price of additional complexity in the design process and in choosing a grasp from the large number of possibilities. Mechanical grasping theory, which has been thoroughly studied in the last 20 years, provides objective methods for evaluating grasps, but the field has lacked a tool that can apply this analysis to arbitrary grasps of objects using different robotic hands. This thesis presents a grasping simulator that can aid both robotic hand designers and those planning grasping tasks. It provides a user with an interactive environment where he or she can manipulate the degrees of freedom of any given hand model to form grasps. As contact between the links of the hand and an object occur, the simulator analyzes the new grasp on the fly and provides the user with},

abstract ={This study was aimed at describing temporal synergies of hand movement and determining the influence of sensory cues on the control of these synergies. Subjects were asked to reach to and grasp various objects under three experimental conditions: (1) memory-guided movements, in which the object was not in view during the movement; (2) virtual object, in which a virtual image of the object was in view but the object was not physically present; and (3) real object, in which the object was in view and physically present. Motion of the arm and of 15 degrees of freedom of the hand was recorded. A principal components analysis was developed to provide a concise description of the spatiotemporal patterns underlying the motion. Vision of the object during the reaching movement had no influence on the kinematics, and the effect of the physical presence of the object became manifest primarily after the fingers had contacted the object. Two principal components accounted for >75% of the variance. For both components, there was a strong positive correlation in the rotations of metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. The first principal component exhibited a pattern of finger extension reversing to flexion, whereas the second principal component became important only in the second half of the reaching movement.},

The proposed Grasp-RRT planner combines the three main tasks needed for grasping an object: finding a feasible grasp, solving the inverse kinematics and searching a collision-free trajectory that brings the hand to the grasping pose. Therefore, RRT-based algorithms are used to build a tree of reachable and collision-free configurations. During RRT-generation, potential grasping positions are generated and approach movements toward them are computed. The quality of reachable grasping poses is scored with an online grasp quality measurement module which is based on the computation of applied forces in order to diminish the net torque.We also present an extension to a dual arm planner which generates bimanual grasps together with corresponding dual arm grasping motions. The algorithms are evaluated with different setups in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.},
